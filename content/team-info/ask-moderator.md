🟦 You can ask a Moderator to...

👥 Add your team members to the role.
> If we've failed to identify any of your team, this would be an alternative route for your peers to verify.

📇 Change category name.
> This should be your team name, but some variances can be considered.
> Year color should remain as well as any team identifiers (year group and team number).

🎨 Change role name / color.
> Provided it isn't the same or otherwise similar to another team role.

🎮 Change game channel names.
> Both text and voice channel names should contain the game name, but have slight variations to help identify channels when directing users around the server.
> 
> *Unicode emojis can be used for any of the names, but text channel names will default be forced to have no spaces and all lowercase (custom emojis aren't allowed either).*
> If you want to use emojis, please consider reading up on what Discord already provides.
> <https://emojipedia.org/discord/>

💬 Request additional channels.
